# Click Quick! Version 1.1 Changelog
This is the changelog for version 1.1 of Click Quick!

It has been a long, long time since anything was done to improve Click Quick! But today, that is changing. This is a minor update, but not really. A medium one maybe? Who knows? You probably don't care about the changelog anyway. 


## The changelog

Here are some things I changed, if you want to know:
- If you care to know, Version 1.0 was written in Swift 2.0, and now in Version 1.1, Click Quick! has been rewritten from the ground up in Swift 4.whatever-it-is-now. 
- Version 1.0 utilized a game engine known as SpriteKit. SpriteKit is good and all, but it was not really the best option to use in creating a game like Click Quick. In Version 1.1, SpriteKit is no more, and Click Quick! now utilizes UIKit only. This is beneficial for the developers because the code is a lot more clean, and a lot less of it too.
- In Version 1.0, there was a bug where if you closed the app during the pre-game countdown, the timer would go in to the negative numbers. So that's gone and you are welcome.
- There is now a dedicated settings view in the app where you can do various things without having to leave the application. How neat?
- The randomness has been totally reworked to actually be random, and to be more efficient at being random. Like seriously. It went from like 800 lines of code to create the random games, to 30 lines of code. I was young and dumb back then when I wrote the original app. Thats my excuse, and no, I do not care what you think.
- Some people that I have talked to have said it was hard to select the answer, or that they would click the right answer but it wouldn't register. That is fixed in this version. In the previous version, your click had to be almost exact, but now there is some leeway. If you are in the vicinity of the correct answer, it will register now. Sorry about the phones that were smashed out of rage. My b.
- The changing background color was confusing, so I removed it. You're welcome. Unless you liked it... then sorry. But its now replaced with confetti!
- A person once told me the icon looked stupid, so I told them that they were stupid, but its now changed. If you don't like it.... ouch and feel free to click the "email developer" button in app.
- If you are bilingual, click the "help translate" button in settings and you can help translate the app into any language. If you'd like to contribute your knowledge for free, that'd be rad!
- Apps these days have "dark modes" and now this one does too. You're welcome? Yes.
- Yep, I might be a sell out, but advertisements are now being shown in this version. I know it really does suck, but college is a thing, and your boy is not gonna get any scholarships anytime soon and money does not grow on trees. However, I am not a tool and I'm not trying to show you an ad after every game that you accidentally click. There is one banner ad on the main menu and the game over screen. No ads during game, and they will not pop up and trick you. I am not into that.
- Proper credit is given to all of the developers who contributed their work for free
- There is now even more setting options.

I want to thank you all for playing Click Quick! and making it through this novel of a changelog. Some developers like to say "sprayed for bugs in this version" or something cute. And I guess I can count myself as one of those people because I literally just did that, but I wanted you guys (and gals) to be informed of all the things changed. You know, knowledge and stuff. But seriously thanks and tell your friends and parents or whoever.
