# What's new in Version 1.1.1

So....uh.....this is awkward......

It turns out that I made some fatal mistakes while programming Click Quick! Version 1.1. So, this update should hopefully fix some of these problems. In case you are wondering, in this version I have restructured how the app handles the multiple ViewControllers in a hopefully more reliable and smoother way. Also, the game actually vibrates now, if you want that. If not, you can turn it off in settings. You're welcome.

I truly would like to apologize to any users who's games crashed on v1.1. If you ever encounter any problems with your Click Quick experience, please email me at developer@nicelion.com

Thanks and have a great day! God bless.

------- What's new in Version 1.1? -------

It has been a long, long time since anything was done to improve Click Quick! But today, that is changing. This is a minor update, but not really. A medium one maybe? Who knows? You probably don't care about the changelog anyway. But before you just click update and skim past this: thanks for downloading Click Quick!
Here are some things I changed if you want to know:
- If you care to know, Version 1.0 was written in Swift 2.0, and now in Version 1.1, Click Quick! has been rewritten from the ground up in Swift 4.whatever-it-is-now. 
- Version 1.0 utilized a game engine known as SpriteKit. SpriteKit is good and all, but it was not really the best option to use in creating a game like Click Quick. In Version 1.1, SpriteKit is no more, and Click Quick! now utilizes UIKit only. This is beneficial for the developers because the code is a lot cleaner, and a lot less of it too.
- In Version 1.0, there was a bug where if you closed the app during the pre-game countdown, the timer would go into the negative numbers. So that's gone and you are welcome.
- There is now a dedicated settings view in the app where you can do various things without having to leave the application. How neat?
- The randomness has been totally reworked to actually be random and to be more efficient at being random. Like seriously. It went from like 800 lines of code to create the random games, to 30 lines of code. I was young and dumb back then when I wrote the original app. That's my excuse, and no, I do not care what you think.
- Some people that I have talked to have said it was hard to select the answer, or that they would click the right answer but it wouldn't register. That is fixed in this version. In the previous version, your click had to be almost exact, but now there is some leeway. If you are in the vicinity of the correct answer, it will register now. Sorry about the phones that were smashed out of rage. My b.
- The changing background color was confusing, so I removed it. You're welcome. Unless you liked it... then sorry. But its now replaced with confetti!
- A person once told me the icon looked stupid, so I told them that they were stupid, but its now changed. If you don't like it.... ouch and feel free to click the "email developer" button in the app.
- If you are bilingual, click the "help translate" button in settings and you can help translate the app into any language. If you'd like to contribute your knowledge for free, that'd be rad!
- Apps these days have "dark modes" and now this one does too. You're welcome? Yes.
- Yep, I might be a sellout, but advertisements are now being shown in this version. I know it really does suck, but college is a thing, and your boy is not gonna get any scholarships anytime soon and money does not grow on trees. However, I am not a tool and I'm not trying to show you an ad after every game that you accidentally click. There is one banner ad on the main menu and the game over screen. No ads during the game and they will not pop up and trick you. I am not into that.
- Proper credit is given to all of the developers who contributed their work for free
- There are now, even more, setting options. And it is now in the app.
